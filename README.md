# ECP Data and Visualization Facility Configurations

This is a repository to keep a history of the configuration files developed in the process of deploying the SDK and SDK member packages at facilities via spack.

Currently this work is being done in parallel with facility maintainers and E4S. The purpose of this repository is to hopefully provide more frequent updates than the aforementioned projects.

## Directory Layout

The configurations are organized by `<Facility>/<System>/<Day>.<Month>.<Year>/`. This is similar to how the other projects have organized their snapshots, however it includes a day in the time stamp since some of these configs will move more often as facilities make updates.

## How to Use
